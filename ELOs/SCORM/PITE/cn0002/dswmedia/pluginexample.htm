<!-- the terminateCommunication() call could be placed within the plugin file. However, placing it
outside helps ensure proper termination if the user exits the content in an ungraceful manner. Place
the terminateCommunication() call in the body tag. One could also place the initializeCommunication()
call here, instead of in the plugin file.
