	<p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
	<p>The purpose of this content collection is to provide Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM&reg;) conformant examples and information using activities with the Plug-In Technologies, Flash and Director to developers using the specific technology.  A plug-in technology is a language, tool, or environment not processed by the Web browser, but rather by a trusted third party provided as a &ldquo;plug-in&rdquo; to the browser&rsquo;s environment.  This content collection is targeted to developers already familiar with SCORM and at least one of the chosen plug-in technologies.  The intention of this content collection is to familiarize developers with using a plug-in technology activity in context.</p>
