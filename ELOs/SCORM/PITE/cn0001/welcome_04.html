	<p><strong>What&rsquo;s in it for Me?</strong></p>
	<p>This content collection will demonstrate learner activities using a plug-in technology in content through the use of three SCORM Run-Time Environment Data Model elements, Comments From Learner, Objectives and Interactions. </p>
	<p>The content does more than just simply explain how to implement activities with these elements. Each data model element is demonstrated while sample code and the learning management system (LMS) communication is displayed. All code includes comments to help developers better understand why and how the calls are used. Content is also provided to explain what JavaScript calls are important for each technology and how the Application Program Interface (API) is used to initialize communication with the LMS. </p>
